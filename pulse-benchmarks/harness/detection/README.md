# detectbench — does Pulse call a training run correctly?

Pulse's value is that it notices a run has gone wrong before you do. That is a claim
about two things, and only one of them is usually measured: catching broken runs, and
*not* interrupting healthy ones. A detector that flags a healthy run gets switched off
by its user, and then it detects nothing at all — so false alarms are scored here as
failures, exactly like misses.

Nothing here is installed into Pulse. It runs against the package in `~/pulseml`.

## The suites

| file | what it asks |
|---|---|
| `run_detectbench.py` | 67 labelled runs, replayed epoch by epoch: are the 39 broken ones caught and the 25 healthy ones left alone? |
| `sweep.py` | the same 67 runs under 30 fresh draws of their noise and 5 sensitivity settings — 10,050 replays, to separate a threshold that is right from one that was fitted to a lucky curve |
| `edge_cases.py` | 63 hostile inputs: `None` values, strings, 1e300, NaN from the first reading, 200 variables, a 50k-step history, unicode names. A detector that raises takes the training run with it |
| `wiring.py` | drives `_record_keras_logs` with the log dicts Keras actually emits, and asks the real detector. This is the failure a curve benchmark cannot see |
| `legacy.py` | scores the detector that ships on the default path, against the same runs, side by side with the engine |

```
python3 run_detectbench.py          # add --sensitivity 0.5, --json out.json
python3 sweep.py --seeds 30
python3 edge_cases.py && python3 wiring.py && python3 legacy.py
```

## Results

At the default sensitivity (0.3), on the 67 labelled runs:

```
caught       39/39 broken runs
false alarms  0/25 healthy runs
latency      median 16 epochs
```

Across 30 redraws of every curve's noise, at five sensitivities — 10,050 replays:

| sensitivity | caught | false alarms |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | 1170/1170 (100%) | 3/750 (0.4%) |
| 0.3 *(default)* | 1170/1170 (100%) | 4/750 (0.5%) |
| 0.5 | 1170/1170 (100%) | 9/750 (1.2%) |
| 0.7 | 1170/1170 (100%) | 26/750 (3.5%) |
| 0.9 | 1170/1170 (100%) | 110/750 (14.7%) |

Recall holds at 100% across the whole dial and false alarms rise monotonically, which
is what a sensitivity knob is supposed to do: the dial buys quiet, not detection.

Hostile input: 63/63 — no input crashed the detector, and none of them silently
mutated the caller's history.

## What the benchmark found

**Round 1 — the detector being measured was not the one running.** Pulse had three
deterministic detectors. `pulse_detect.DetectionEngine` is the one its tests cover, and
it was reachable only under `PULSE_MODE=stream`; a normal `pulse run` used a second,
untested implementation, and the Tk dashboard a third. On these runs the shipped one
scored **36/39 caught, 10/25 false alarms** — a deliberate learning-rate drop, a
converged run at its floor, a fine-tune, a GAN, a noisy validation split. All three
paths now run the engine; `PULSE_LEGACY_DETECTOR=1` reproduces the old numbers.

Then, in the engine itself:

1. **Nothing checked whether the loss was going up.** A run diverging steadily without
   ever spiking was caught 15 times in 30 — by luck, through other checks.
2. **"This run is not learning" was a coin flip on any noisy curve.** It disqualified
   itself if a single reading had ever dipped below the opening; noise does that.
3. **Oscillation was a white-noise detector** — ≥12 direction changes in 19 readings,
   where iid noise flips about two in three. It now requires *systematic* alternation.
4. **Stagnation could not tell "converged" from "stalled"**, and fired on runs that had
   come down 99% and were sitting at their floor.
5. **Overfitting and validation drift compared two numbers without asking whether the
   gap beat the noise.** Healthy peaks at 2.0σ, real faults reach 6.6σ.
6. **A 1e300 loss and a malformed tensor summary each crashed the detector**, which
   takes the training run down with it.
7. **A 50k-reading history cost 1.6s per update**, taken out of the training loop.

**Round 2 — widening 37 runs to 67** found six more misses and two false alarms:

8. **float32 was discarded entirely.** `isinstance(v, (int, float))` is true for numpy's
   float64, which subclasses float, and false for float32 — the Keras default and
   everything under mixed precision. Every reading of such a run was dropped, so no
   check ever ran, including the NaN check. Torch scalars and 0-dim arrays too.
9. **Nothing noticed the same readings coming round again**, bit for bit: an exhausted
   iterator re-used, or per-epoch state resetting.
10. **Nothing noticed a run getting slower.** A climbing step time is a leak that ends
    as an out-of-memory kill; it is not a loss, score, norm or learning rate, so nothing
    looked at it.
11. **A steadily growing weight norm never tripped the spike test**, because the recent
    average it was compared against grew with it.
12. **A leak that took ten epochs to saturate was invisible** — "suspiciously perfect"
    only looked at a metric's first six readings.
13. **A loss improving while accuracy sat at chance was INFO.** Shuffled labels: the
    loss is optimising something the metric does not measure.
14. **Every ratio test changed direction with the sign**, so an ELBO flat at −3.2 forever
    passed `end >= start * 0.98` trivially.
15. **A slope alone flags anything that oscillates.** Over less than one period a sine is
    a straight line: an RL policy loss measured 6 standard errors and explained 75% of
    its variance while going nowhere, against 16–59 and >90% for real divergences.
16. **A quantised metric read as frozen.** 197 right out of 200 is exactly 0.985 every
    epoch — the score having converged, not the run having died.

Three runs are reported but not scored either way: a flat 30 epochs before a late
breakthrough (grokking), a genuinely easy task where accuracy really is 1.0, and a loss
falling without bound past zero — which is a sign error, and also what a healthy density
model's log-likelihood does.

## Still true after this

- `healthy_noisy_validation` and `healthy_step_level` still flap on about 1 draw in 15
  at the default sensitivity. Both are runs whose noise is larger than their trend over
  the window being judged; tightening further starts costing recall.
- Detection says a run has gone wrong, not what to change. Everything downstream of the
  finding is the agent's job, and is measured by the JunoBench and Deep4ge suites.
